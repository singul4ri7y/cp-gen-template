Windows users also can use it in conjunction with 3rd party projects like [snaury/script-runner](https://github.com/snaury/script-runner) and use it in CMD or PowerShell alternatively.

To use the scripts of this projects, first you need to install Promit interpreter into your computer. The installation manual can be found [here](https://github.com/singul4ri7y/promit#install).

Go to `config.promit` and edit the configuration which befits you.

Move the `gen` and `config.promit` files to `/usr/local/bin` (Linux/Unix/Darwin) or in `PATH` (Windows).

Enjoy.
